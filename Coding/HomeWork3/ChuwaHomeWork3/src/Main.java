            String Pool in Java is a special memory area in the heap that stores unique String literals.
            When you create a String like "Hello", Java checks the pool first‚Äîif it exists, it reuses it; if not, it adds it. This improves memory efficiency and performance.
            Strings are immutable, meaning their state can't change after creation. This makes them:
            Thread-safe (no sync needed)
            Ideal for hash keys
            Secure for use in class loading, caching, etc.
            We need the String pool because:
            It reduces memory footprint
            Enables reuse of objects, aligning with OOP principles like efficiency and encapsulation.
