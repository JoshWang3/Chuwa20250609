1. Solve following questions using Stream API, you should write complete code context rather than a
single Stream API statement (please also write necessary POJO classes or helper code):

	1. Find top 3 longest strings that start with a vowel

	[Top3LongestVowelStrings](../../Coding/HW5/src/Top3LongestVowelStrings.java)

	2. Return names of departments where average employee salary > 100,000

	[DepartmentsByAvgSalary](../../Coding/HW5/src/DepartmentsByAvgSalary.java)

	3. Get a sorted list of all unique tags from a list of blog posts (Blog to Tags is 1-to-many relationship)

	[SortedUniqueTags](../../Coding/HW5/src/SortedUniqueTags.java)

	4. Return top 5 words by frequency from a paragraph

	[Top5WordFrequency](../../Coding/HW5/src/Top5WordFrequency.java)

	5. Group products by category and sort each group by price descending

	[GroupProductsByCategory](../../Coding/HW5/src/GroupProductsByCategory.java)

2. Write code snippet to explain how Optional helps prevent null pointer exception, you may use blog-tags, and product-category POJOs to demo.

[OptionalDemo](../../Coding/HW5/src/OptionalDemo.java)

3. Explain why Java Stream API is required, how does it help on data processing?

* Makes code more readable, concise, and functional
* Reduces boilerplate like loops and temp lists
* Enables easy parallel processing
* Provides powerful collectors for aggregation
* Is perfect for data-heavy tasks like filtering, transforming, and summarizing
