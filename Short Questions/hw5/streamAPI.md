Stream API is needed in case of efficiently managing data processing in a stream manner (mimicking data pipelines).

It not only saves memory by preventing creating copies of the original data (list, arrays, etc.) but also provides powerful and useful functions that enables chain of operations (serialized operations -- filter, map, etc. with terminal operation to output final result) without the need of using repetitive if-else statements or for loops which is not only hard to read but also adds redundant lines to the code base.
